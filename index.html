            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm passionate about designing innovative solutions. Growing up I've always had an engineering outlook on life which had allowed me to become the engineer I am today. I've expressed this line of thought throughout my life wether that be designing my own ideas through LEGOs, building miniature cars with my VEX kit, analyzing the enginnering of the rollecatser I just rode on, analyzing the go-karting line I should take to improve my lap time or how the Porsche 911 is able to go so fast. I am excited for what my future education holds at Iowa State and all the challenges that are presented to me as they will not only grow me as a person but as a Mechanical Engineer.</p>

                <h3>Hydrogen Motor Boat</h3>
                <p>As apart of the PLTW class I took we had to make a miniature boat that was powered from a provided hydrogen motor. We were tasked with creating a boat that could travel from point A to B the quickest out of our class. I designed a gearbox and propeller which effectiveley increased the rate at which the propeller spun at the cost of having less torque, which the gear ratio was carfully resarched and implemented to maximize efficencey. Additionally the propeller that I designed also had to be carefully implemented as if the propeller was too curved it would catch too much water and would slow down the boat but if it didn't catch enough water the boat wouldn't move. This again had to be carefully implimented in order to maximize the effiecency and speed at which the water was displaced. After many itterations the day of the race came and our group won.</p>
